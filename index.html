        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">
            Our project aims to create a captivating LEGO art piece depicting the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) map in downtown Boston,
            with added features to provide real-time information of the subway system. Through several LEDs spread throughout the map, this project visually
            represents the precise locations of trains within the MBTA network based on their most recent stop, offering commuters and enthusiasts an interactive
            and informative experience.
        </p>
        <p class="product-description">
            In conjunction with the LEGO art installation, we will develop a complementary mobile application. This app will empower users to seamlessly connect
            the artwork to the internet, facilitating the acquisition of real-time train data and unlocking a host of personalized map features. These capabilities
            encompass tracking a specific train’s journey within the system and offering clear guidance on navigating from one station to another, enhancing the overall
            interactivity and functionality of this creative masterpiece.

                <p>The ESP-WROOM-32-N4 comes with integrated support for both WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing the microcontroller to connect to both the Android
                    application and the internet simultaneously. This combined with its availability and ability to host two SPI buses are motivating factors in the
                    selection of the ESP as the microcontroller used.</p>

                <p>These LEDs are individually addressable, which will allow us to wire them in series and still have the ability to communicate to each one individually.
                    They are also multicolored which will give us more flexibility in the dynamic nature of the map (e.g., allowing us to change the color of the LED based
                    on the map mode).</p>

                <p>The bottom corner of our art piece will contain an LED screen that can be interacted with via our mobile application. On top of being able to see the live
                    location of each train through the PL9823 LEDs, a user may also view a specific train’s arrival and departure time on the LED panel.</p>

                <p>The mobile application will allow the user to connect the art piece to their local WiFi network so the map is able to get train data from the MBTA-API.
                    This data will include train locations, estimated arrival time, train capacity and more. The app will also allow for more personalized functionality such
                    as displaying directions from one point on the map to another or for getting more tailored information on a key train of interest.</p>
